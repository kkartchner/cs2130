# cs2130
Programming assignments from my Weber State Computational Structures (CS 2130) class, taken Summer 2020 semester.

## Program1 - Set Operations:
Calculates the union, intersection, and difference of two hard coded sets and displays the results using set notation.

### Output:
```
A = {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}
B = {2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
AuB = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
AnB = {3}
A-B = {1, 5, 6, 8}
```
## Program2 - Sentence Hashing:
Prompts the user for a "sentence" to be hashed and then displays the result.
Continues to prompt user until they enter in sentinel value 'q' to exit.

### Example Output:
```
Welcome to SentenceHasher!
Enter a sentence consisting only of letters and spaces(no numbers or other symbols allowed) to receive its hash value.
If at any point, you are all hashed-out, enter 'q' to exit.

Enter the sentence to be hashed or 'q' to exit: hello
Computed hash is: 21

Enter the sentence to be hashed or 'q' to exit:
```

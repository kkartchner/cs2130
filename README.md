# cs2130
Programming assignments from my Weber State Computational Structures (CS 2130) class, taken Summer 2020 semester.

## Program1 - Set Operations:
Calculates the union, intersection, and difference of two hard coded sets and displays the results using set notation.

### Output:
```
A = {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}
B = {2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
AuB = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
AnB = {3}
A-B = {1, 5, 6, 8}
```
